# Thomas Le Reun

I am presently a R&D engineer at Saint-Gobain Research in Paris. My main expertise lies in fluid dynamics with a particular focus on turbulence, rotating flows and heat transport. In the past, I have used numerical simulations, experiments and theoretical models to tackle problems that arise in geo- and astrophysical contexts. For instance, my past projects include tidally driven turbulence in planetary cores or porous-fluid convection in icy satellites. You may find out more scrolling through my [[publications]]. 

### A short résumé
Before moving to Saint-Gobain Research, I was a *Royal Society Newton International Fellow* at the University of Cambridge. Before that, I was a PhD student at *IRPHÉ* in Marseille.
